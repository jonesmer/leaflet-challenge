### exercise using leaflet

This repository contains two files: an html file and a javascript file. The javascript code calls the USGS API for earthquake data and loads it onto the html page.

Most of this code is my own (although it's very similar to one of the exercises we did in class). I did use Leaflet's [code](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) to create the legend.
